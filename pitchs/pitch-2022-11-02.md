here my picht base on my documention 
From my questionnaire that I ask to people, I figure out that how de take medication can affect the personne’s time line and the way they organize that to take medication change also how they use theirs time. For example for the people who have diabetes issue it’s not the same consequence in their time line of the day or even the time line of their life. People become more on time. it look like the time is more pressure for them than the others.I could be very interesting to see difference of perception of time between the kids with health issu and the others. they are two case i'm very intressed in the diabet case because of retual and the aged personne who has lot of medication.
